# drie-php-starter-app 1

A barebones PHP app, based on the [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) framework.

## Requirements

1. [PHP](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php). Note on macOS PHP is installed out of the box but is some versions behind the current release.
2. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/). Follow the command-line instructions at the top of the page to install Composer in your working directory. These commands will leave a file named `composer.phar` in your working directory which you can use to run `composer` commands.

## Setup

We've used [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to create the project and manage the dependencies. Once you've cloned this repo you can install dependencies using `composer install`.

## Development

You can test changes locally with the following command once you've set everything up: `php artisan serve`.
